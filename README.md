# HealthMate

**HealthMate** is an AI-powered health diagnosis and medical record management application. Built with Streamlit, HealthMate provides a comprehensive platform where users can securely sign up, log in, consult with an intelligent medical chatbot for symptom analysis and diagnosis, and manage/upload their medical records (PDFs) for further review and discussion.

## Features

- **User Authentication:**  
  Secure sign-up and login functionality using SQLite. New users can register, and existing users can log in to access the system.

- **Symptom Checker & Consultation:**  
  Chat with "CuraBot" — an AI doctor powered by Google Generative AI (Gemini) — to get insights into your symptoms, possible diagnoses, and medication recommendations. The chatbot maintains conversation context and provides responses tailored to medical report content.

- **Medical Record Reader & Organizer:**  
  Upload your medical records (PDFs) securely. The app extracts text from your documents, splits the content into manageable chunks using LangChain text splitters, and indexes the content with FAISS for similarity search. You can then interact with your medical records via a dedicated chat interface.

- **Secure File Handling:**  
  Uploaded files are stored locally in a dedicated directory. File metadata is maintained in a SQLite database for easy retrieval and management.

- **Intelligent Document Analysis:**  
  With document chunking and vector search, the chatbot can retrieve relevant sections from your uploaded records to answer your questions based on the document content.
